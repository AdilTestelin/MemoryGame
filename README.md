# MemoryGame
A quick Memory Game using basic javascript functions.

<h1> Rules : </h1>
The aim is to match all the cards that are on backside.

To match those cards, you must :

* Turn two cards that are on backside.  

* If they are of same color (for exemple two heart cards) or of same height (for example two 10 cards), they stay returned.  

* Else we return those cards on backside.  

  
  
First, cards are charged by the HTML in backside.
All cards are set with a different id, to differentiate them all with each other.
There is the same onclick function on all the cards.
